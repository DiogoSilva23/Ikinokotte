## What is Ikinokotte?

This website is destined to offer a game where you can have your own digital pet to take care of it and interact with it in various ways and activities. The origin of this website's name comes from the meaning of Ikinokotte. Basically, "ikinokotte", or 生き残って, is a japanese word that means survive (to someone survive), which it leads you to treat ur pet in a way that he can survives. It's like a challenge to make it survive for a long time, since it takes various cares to make it live longer. The idea of the game is still a pretty basic one, so it is to expect that in the future there will be a lot more functionalities in it.

## What is the purpose of this project?

### The purpose for the creators

For us, this project is a way to expand our knowledge on Computer Science, by using new development tools. We also look foward to have some fun while developing this website as well, because we are just kinda bored.

### The purpose for the users

We want you to have a good time and enjoy our website in a way that makes you comeback when you have the urge to play. We just simply want to let you play freely with your pet and take care of him on a daily basis, or whenever you feel like it (just please don't let him starve to death). Jokes aside, we will look foward to make it a pleasant expirience for the users.

## Who are the creators of Ikinokotte?

The creators of Ikinokotte are a few senior Computer Science students which just want to have some fun and learn new things in the process of the project.
